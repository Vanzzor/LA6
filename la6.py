"""

To start we generate a random integer between 1 and 20, and based on the resuelt of the random code, we check to see if it falls
under certain range
if the number is greater than 35 then the results will be "cherries"
otherwise if the number is > 10, then the result will be orange
other wise if the number is >5 , then the results will be plum,
otherwise if the number is > 2 then the result will be "Melon"
otherwise if the number is > 1, then the result will be "bell"
if the number is not any of the above, then the results will be "bar:

we iterate over using a loop three times and print the results to the user, as an example plum cherries"
